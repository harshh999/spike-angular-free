# 🚀 Spike Angular Admin Dashboard – Custom by Harsh

This is a customized version of the **Spike Free Angular Admin Dashboard** I tweaked and set up for my own learning and experimenting.

It’s built using Angular 14+ and Angular Material — perfect if you just wanna get a slick UI up and running for any dashboard-type project.
